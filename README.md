## Implementation details

### embedding layer
- input -> embedding is a fully connected layer
- we build 4 embeddings, user-MLP, user-GMF, movie-MLP, movie-GMF
- if MLP is 3 layers, then embedding length is 2x predictive factors (see [evaluation](### evaluation))
### MLP
- ReLu activation
- each higher layer has 1/2 the number of units
- 3 hidden layers
- last layer is lenth of predictive factors
    - each earlier layer is 2x the previous

### GMF

### total system
- pretrain GMF and MLP
- ADAM during pretraining, vanilla SGD after

### evaluation
- leave one out evaluation
- randomly sample 100 items not interacted by the user, and rank the test item among 100 items
- Hit rate and NDCG
- random sample 1 interaction for each user as validation data, and tune hyper-parameters on it
- sample four negative instance per positive instance
- last layer of NCF = predictive factors, evaluated at [8,16,32,64]
